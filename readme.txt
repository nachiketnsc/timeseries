# Time Series Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing the historical prices of a commodity over a series of days and building predictive models using ARMA and ARIMA techniques. The models are designed to forecast future price trends based on the data.

## Description

- Analyzed historical time-series data for a commodity.
- Conducted differencing and correlation analysis to identify key patterns and make the data stationary.
- Built and trained predictive models using ARMA and ARIMA methodologies.
- Forecasted future price trends based on the trained models.
